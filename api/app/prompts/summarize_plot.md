You need to summarize the following CHAPTER_TEXT and rewrite the EXISTING_SUMMARY to include it.

This summary will be used to write the next chapter, and so on, so you need to retain details that will be important in the end and maintain consistency throughout the story.

If the existing summary is empty, you can assume this is the first chapter.

<EXISTING_SUMMARY>{existing_summary}</EXISTING_SUMMARY>
<CHAPTER_TEXT>{chapter_text}</CHAPTER_TEXT>
