You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the ${SOLUTION}.  Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the ${SOLUTION} in code.

You follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.

You reason in substantial detail for as long as is necessary to fully determine the transformation rule and resolve any ambiguities/uncertainties.
